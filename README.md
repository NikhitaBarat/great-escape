## Inspiration
We believe this hackathon is a great opportunity for our career-boost.  Moreover, this coastal theme is exciting and we would love to build some good UI designs for this. It's a great learning point to pitch new ideas, learn, improve our present skills and find the right approach to make this project successful. 
## What it does
Great Escape is a travel planner website. It recommends some features which allows to plan every aspect of your trip, from transport and accommodation to booking hotels, spending time in water sports. It shows numerous booking options, price details, and provides you the option to create your own custom-made travel bucket list.
## How we built it
We started off by planning and customizing the UI design and what major things to include. Then we proceeded to build the backend, deal with database then tested and finalized. To make this project, we used many tech stacks and APIs. Some of them include - React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Auth0, MongoDB, GraphQL, Mongoose, etc.
## Challenges we ran into
We faced some issues while dealing with git version control when we tried pushing multiple commits but later we could figure that out. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We could successfully implement new features we learnt for this hackathon like GraphQL and could test out some others successfully.
## What we learned
We learned about some APIs. Most importantly, this hackathon taught us how to work and contribute together and accomplish more together, some troubleshooting methodologies and engaging with different tech stacks. 
## What's next for Great Escape
We are planning to implement a decentralized system for booking rooms, implement itinerary and map in one view with no need of switching tabs, collaborate with friends in real time and a system to get personalized recommendations.
